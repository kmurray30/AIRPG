Learning Notes

"React is the VVM of MVVM"
"Don't really have MVVM in python". Bc of this, and my app is just one view, I should just stick to using MVP for my python demo
MVC just means the actions come through the controller and go into the view. The view controls both the view and the logic, which is lame. MVP is a better bifurcation of view vs logic
