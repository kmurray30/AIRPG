TODO

- Figure out why copilot chat window is not showing up - on the right side now (via top button)
- Make the image prompt metadata at the top and pass in the variable strings when invoked (ie the prompt)
UTs
Skip initial narration
	Fix the modularity so that skipping the intro looks better
	Don't cancel the background music when skipping
throw an error when calling openai
Put a try catch around everything
Recreate the repo to post date ms
organize the temp output to make reproduceable scenes
remove text from images
Make the initial narration from a premade file rather than calling the API each time (and move to asset folder)
Be able to plop into different worlds than just 
	Have it scrub any trademarked stuff from the image generation

Refactoring
	Make the speech logic more modular
		I think I call different functions for summary and intro than I do for everything else
		The "skip" button logic was duplicated for this as well
	Get rid of the utility classes
	Probably isolate the
	Better method names
	Create classes for methods?

Steps:
1	Copy and paste repo with new name
2	github
3	Start rebuilding from scratch

Design
	Isolate the UI to one class, have it call different classes
		MVP?

Audio
	playsound only uses wav which might run into issues with generating AI audio quickly
	pydub is blocking and can't easily be stopped without spinning up a whole separate process
	pygame requires you to use pygame for UI
	PyAudio
	playsound

Music gen
	Udio

Notes:
	The first time, you directly call submit_prompt_and_narrate_task
	Every other time, the send button calls send_prompt_task, which generates the summary and then calls submit_prompt_and_narrate_task
	I should instead just call the same thing but put "intro" to false? nah bc there's other stuff
	A jankier way is to just make the intro special and skippable in spant

11/29 Notes:
	I need to figure out a way to set up my audio system
	Currently I spin up a thread and pass in a cancel token. This requires an extra thread that is running until cancelled, which is kind of wasteful
	I could have one class instance for all audio, or I could have instance per audio being played
	NTS: Apparently all instance methods need to include "self" as the first parameter
TODO
	print stacktrace of exception
12/3 Notes:
TODO
	fix segfault
		why is it working in original but not this?
		it was the evil simpleaudio issue... it requires python 11 not 12
	Get cancel token working
	App can exit when clicking X
	Create a logger class with debug levels
	original app I don't think switches the button function back from skip
12/11 Notes:
	Design
		Initial
			Take in generated image and audio
			Play them
			Set button to skip
		Button
			Take user prompt
			Generate image and audio
			Wait
			While waiting play the vamping audio
			Once generated and vamping is done, call the display function
	Button and text disabling/enabling
		When skip is pressed, set button to "send" and enable it and text
		When send is pressed, send text to window, disable button and text
		When scene is ready and being played, set button to skip and enabled (leave text disabled)
	TODO
		Button enabling/disabling
		Intial scene (as opposed to title scene) should start generating right away, then wait for audio to finish or skip, then play
		Create an event listener for when the audio stops playing or is skipped, for the initial scene to not start until audio is done playing, and subsequent scenes to unlock the send and text field once audio is done playing.
12/12 Notes:
	DEBUG
		Ooh this is because of the race condition of vamp and gpt being on different threads
			It is using the vamping as the response somehow
			It somehow didn't include the system prompt in the gpt call, and keeps the vamping sometimes...
		the narration started taking forever...
		X restarts the audio loop now
	TODO
		-
		-handle empty input
		*try catches everywhere
		return function (idk what I meant by this when I wrote it...)
		**make view not protocol
		audio plays before the mainloop so photo is delayed?
		Handle temp audio file deletion (can delete anything in temp periodically)
		Handle temp image file deletion
		clean up threads
		Clean up chatsession file to take out all the openai stuff
		null checks everywhere
		organize
		audio manager class? for state machine and tokens etc
		~handle inappropriate content flags from chatgpt
		handle case if skip button being pressed before narration starts
		***DEBUG mode to pass in fake images and narration
		*Make the different gpt chat calls more thread safe
		logger
		infinite context window
		always snap the chat window to the most recent texts
		timeouts / indicators of how long each thing is taking
		TODOs in code
